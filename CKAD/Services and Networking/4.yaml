# Try to access the set of Pods through the Service from within the cluster.
# Which pods does the service select. 
#

# to hit service we will run a temp pod:
kubectl run busybox --image=busybox --restart=Never -it --rm -- /bin/sh

# this will get you in the shell. from shell use wget to reach teh service ip:port
/ # wget --spider --timeout=1 IP:port
wget --spider --timeout=1 10.96.184.104:9000
 
# we did not reach any pods. as pod selector fields point to labels that do not have any matching pods. 
# to see which pods service selects do:
kubectl describe service nginx-service
# you can notice in Selector: deployment:app,tier=backend
